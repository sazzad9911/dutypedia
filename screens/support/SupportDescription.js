              To ensure a secure and reliable transaction process, our platform

              online services, such as receipts, files, lessons, or
              consultations. Sellers must take appropriate measures, such as
              taking screenshots or recording 10-20 second videos, to prove that
              the service has been delivered. Providing fake documents or proof
              is strictly prohibited and will result in the termination of the

              In case a seller delivers all files to the buyer, but the buyer

              this responsibility very seriously. As such, we have implemented a
              strict requirement for all sellers to provide proper delivery

              For physical services such as tuition, lessons, consultation, home
              or office maintenance, or any other physical delivery activities,
              sellers must obtain proof of delivery. This entails the seller
              clicking on the "yes, I delivered" button in front of the buyer,
              as well as requesting the buyer to confirm that they have received
              the service satisfactorily by clicking on the "yes, I received"
              button. Additionally, the seller must upload delivery proof
              documents when they click the "yes, I delivered" button.

              If a seller utilizes an employee or labor to deliver the service,
              they must click on the "yes, I delivered" button in front of the
              buyer, and the employee or labor must request the buyer to click
              on the "yes, I received" button to confirm that the service has
              been delivered satisfactorily. Similarly, when the seller clicks
              the "yes, I delivered" button, they must also provide delivery
              proof documentation.

              At Duty, we strictly prohibit the use of any third-party delivery
              services, such as couriers, for the delivery of services or

              conducted face-to-face to ensure the safety and security of our
              users. If a buyer or seller uses any such third-party services and
